# Building a Web-Based Multi-Bot RPG with LLMs: The Frontend Behind RPGGO

> Ever imagined chatting with a house full of AI characters in a murder mystery? That‚Äôs exactly what we set out to build.

## Intro

Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping how we interact with software. But beyond AI chatbots and copilots, they‚Äôre also opening up new possibilities in interactive storytelling and gaming. At RPGGO, we asked ourselves a simple question:

> What if you could talk to a world full of intelligent characters‚Äînot just one?

This tech doc introduces the frontend design and architecture of our web-based, multi-NPC, LLM-powered role-playing game. We‚Äôll walk through how we reengineered an existing open-source project to support complex dialogue flows, coordinated between multiple AI agents.

All the code we refer to is open source, and the game creation tool is free to use. If you've been excited by AI chat projects or dabbled with AI-powered games, you‚Äôll know most of them are either single-bot or lack deeper narrative structures. We wanted to change that‚Äîwith RPGGO, a multi-goal, multi-NPC text RPG platform that gives users a more immersive, game-like experience.

Code‚Äôs open source, too: https://github.com/RPGGO-AI/XTalk


## Project Overview
**Problem**

Most AI chat products‚Äîwhether for productivity or entertainment‚Äîare based on single-agent dialogue. Even existing AI RPG demos often feature only one bot at a time, limiting immersion, narrative depth, and replayability.

We wanted to change that.

**Goal**

Build a front-end framework capable of:

- Supporting dynamic dialogue with multiple AI-controlled characters (NPCs)
- Provide a game-oriented UI (e.g., RPG-style chat window)
- Managing scene transitions, objectives, and game state
- Display contextual story backgrounds and NPC information
- Allowing users to switch between characters naturally
- Ensure responsiveness and extensibility through modular architecture


## Let‚Äôs Imagine a Scene
> A snowy night in 1903, London.
>
> John (a London famous Jeweler) invites George Moss (you, a detective), Mary (John's fianc√©e), Smith (business competitor), James (butler), and Lilith (your assistant, a neutral character) to a manor in the suburbs.
>
> ***An accident suddenly occurs after the meeting. Lilith found John's death on second floor in his room at 9:30PM. A bag of gems with blood scattered around John's body, he is killed by a heavy struck***. All people in the house gathered at John's room after hearing Lilith's screams, and, George Moss, you were the last one arrived at the room...
>
> Everyone walked upstairs at 8:45PM, and no one passed the stairs as you and Lilith were sitting at the first floor watching carefully. Now we are all at the living room on first floor, waiting for your investigations.
>
> All of the suspicious are at the first floor! It's your turn to investigate and find out who killed John.
>
> Your job is to interrogate them, piece together the clues, and solve the mystery.

All the characters except the player are AI Bots. The player must interact with them‚Äîthrough natural dialogue‚Äîto uncover clues, test alibis, and solve the mystery. This is not just a chatbot‚Äîthis is a game powered by coordinated, responsive AI characters. This is the kind of immersive experience we‚Äôre enabling with RPGGO.

## Technology Selection
We evaluated several open-source AI web chat frameworks including:
- LobeChat
- LibreChat
- ChatGPT-Next-Web

![Frontend Evaluation](./imgs/frontend%20evaluation.png)

And in the end, ChatGPT-Next-Web stood out due to its:

- Strong community and active development

- Rich plugin ecosystem and AI provider integrations

- Modern Next.js-based architecture

- Clean and extensible frontend design

This made it an ideal base for rapid prototyping and long-term extensibility.

## Architecture
The original architecture of ChatGPT-Next-Web was not designed with multi-bot conversation systems in mind and therefore could not directly support our requirements for a rich, RPG-style multi-character dialogue experience. To address this, we restructured the architecture significantly, enabling support for concurrent multi-Bot interactions.

Revised Architecture Overview:

![Architecture](./imgs/Architecture%20Diagram.png "Overall Architecture")

Beyond reworking the user interface‚Äîreplacing the conventional chat window with a more immersive, RPG-style dialogue panel‚Äîthe most substantial enhancements were the introduction of two new architectural layers: Logic APIs and Zajii.

Logic APIs: This layer encapsulates core game logic and interaction flow. As a developer, you no longer need to manage the complexities of invoking multiple LLM models, integrating external services, or handling API authentication and deployment. Logic APIs abstract away these details and provide a clean, unified interface for game progression and dialogue management.

Zajii Layer: This component acts as a lower-level abstraction layer over the LLMs. It not only simplifies how models are invoked but also ensures the consistency and stability of the game‚Äôs narrative logic. Zajii enables coordination between multiple NPCs and supports dynamic narrative control‚Äîcritical for an engaging RPG experience.

For those who want to build on top of this system, the Logic API is publicly available here:
üîó https://developer.rpggo.ai/dev-docs/creator-api/v2-api

With this new architecture, developers can focus more on designing meaningful stories and characters, while the underlying infrastructure handles model orchestration, state transitions, and response routing automatically.


## Dialogue Flow
Compared to traditional AI chat systems, implementing a multi-Bot dialogue flow introduces a significant layer of complexity. Fortunately, much of this complexity has been abstracted away in our backend implementation‚Äîso developers interacting with the frontend need not worry about the orchestration logic beneath.

Here‚Äôs an overview of the multi-Bot conversation workflow:

![Dialog Flow](./imgs/dialog%20flow.PNG)

In a conventional LLM-based chat system (such as ChatGPT), the user sends a message via a web interface, and the model responds in a streaming manner via a Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection. That‚Äôs a straightforward, single-agent loop.

However, in our redesigned system, the process is far more dynamic:

Bot Selection ‚Äì Users can choose which NPC (Bot) to engage in conversation with. This selection dictates the immediate dialogue context.

Real-Time Switching ‚Äì The user can switch between Bots at any point during the interaction.

Parallel NPC Participation ‚Äì While the player is talking to one Bot, other Bots can also "observe" the conversation. With the help of the Zajii orchestration layer, relevant Bots may proactively join in if their logic dictates.

Dialogue Arbitration via DM ‚Äì To maintain narrative coherence, a special AI agent we refer to as the DM (Dungeon Master) acts as a dialogue coordinator. It interprets inputs from the player and the Bots, makes decisions about narrative progression, and returns a synthesized, game-aware response to the frontend.

![Dialog Example](./imgs/dialog%20exmaple.png)

This process results in a rich and immersive player experience where conversations feel dynamic and responsive to in-game events and character knowledge.

We highly recommend trying the live demo to experience the full flow firsthand:

While this post focuses on frontend engineering, it‚Äôs worth noting that the backend orchestration of LLMs and state management is itself a fascinating challenge. We‚Äôll cover those architectural details in an upcoming post‚Äîstay tuned.

In the next section, we‚Äôll focus on the frontend implementation: how the user interface and data flow are designed to support this multi-Bot RPG experience.


## Frontend Workflow

When a user enters the game (dialogue) page, the frontend initiates an API call to retrieve the current game data and stores it in the local **Game Store**. Once the player clicks the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button, the frontend sends another request to initialize a new game session. The response from this request is then used to update the client-side state accordingly.

![Game Flow](./imgs/game%20flow.png)

## Interaction Flow

The interaction logic is illustrated in the following diagram. For a closer look at the implementation, refer to the open-source code at:  
üîó [chat.tsx ‚Äì GitHub](https://github.com/RPGGO-AI/XTalk/blob/main/app/components/chat.tsx)

![Interaction](./imgs/frontrend%20interaction.png)


The real gameplay begins the moment the user clicks the **Start** button. Here's a breakdown of what happens next:

#### 1. Game Session Initialization

An API request is sent to initiate the game, and a new session is created on the client side. Its structure looks like this:

```ts
{
  id: nanoid(),
  messages: [],
  gameId: gameId || characterId || cid,
  chapterId: "",
  gameState: GAME_ACTION.CURRENT,
}
```

- `messages`: A list storing the dialogue history between the player and the NPCs, including system-level messages.
- `gameId`: Unique identifier for the current game instance.
- `chapterId`: Each game is broken into chapters; this value tracks the current one.
- `gameState`: A critical field that reflects the current phase of the game, updated dynamically as the player interacts with NPCs.

The `gameState` values include:

```ts
export const GAME_ACTION = {
  CURRENT: 0,     // Dialogue is ongoing in the current chapter
  NEXT_GOAL: 1,   // Transition to the next game objective
  NEXT_SCENE: 2,  // Transition to the next scene
  END: 3,         // Game completed (success)
  FAIL_END: 4,    // Game over (failure)
};
```

#### 2. Updating the Game Store

Upon receiving the session initialization response, the frontend populates the local game state with the returned data, replacing the previously empty session.

##### 2.1 Setting the Scene

The first part of the update includes the **background narrative** of the current chapter. This is shown to the user at the beginning of the session, along with an update to the game status:

```ts
game: {
  ...{
    ...get().game,
    chapter,
    currentCharacter,
    characters,
  },
  state: GAME_STATE.inProgress,
}
```

In addition to the scene background, the **objective** and **chapter information** are displayed on the UI. This guides players on what they‚Äôre trying to accomplish and which NPCs they may need to speak with.

##### 2.2 Initial NPC Dialogue

Next, the frontend renders the initial messages from the NPCs. In our current example, this consists of opening lines from Lilith and James.

![NPC Dialog](./imgs/dialog%20example%202.png)

#### 3. NPC List Update

Each chapter has a unique set of NPCs. This list is included in the API response and is used to update the `characters` field within the **Chat Store**:

```ts
{
  characters: [],
  currentCharacter: {},
}
```

This setup allows the player to interact with a dynamic, context-aware cast of characters‚Äîeach capable of reacting differently based on story progression and prior interactions.

## How Multi-Character Dialogue Works

You may have noticed that all messages in our system‚Äîwhether from the user, an NPC, or the system‚Äîare stored in a single `messages` array. This unified structure simplifies data handling and allows us to render different message types distinctly in the UI.

There are three types of messages:

1. User messages  
2. NPC (Bot) messages  
3. System messages  

These message types are visually differentiated in the interface. For example, the player's avatar is always displayed on the right side of the dialogue window, while NPC avatars appear on the left‚Äîsimilar to how group chats are displayed in Discord.

To initiate a conversation with a specific NPC, the player simply clicks on the character‚Äôs avatar. Behind the scenes, this updates the `currentNPC` state. When a message is sent, it is added to the `messages` array using the following structure:

```ts
{
  id: nanoid(),
  date: new Date().toLocaleString(),
  role: "user",
  content: "",
  user: {},
  ...override,
  messageState: _messageState,
}
```

When the Zajii layer processes and generates a response, it could return either an NPC message or a system message. A typical NPC reply is structured as follows:

```ts
createMessage({
  logId,
  role,
  content: message,
  streaming: false,
  user: get().getCharacterById(nextCharacterId),
  systemMessage,
});
```

In cases where the system determines that the game state should be updated‚Äîsuch as when a goal is reached or the game ends‚Äîa system message is generated from the response data:

```ts
systemMessage: createSystemMessage({
  onlyKey: `${chapterId}_${GAME_ACTION.END}`,
  title: replyContent,
  description: replyText,
  type: SYSTEM_MESSAGE_TYPE.finish,
  action: GAME_ACTION.END,
});
```

System messages serve two main purposes:

1. Displaying background narrative or environmental descriptions.  
2. Updating the game state and notifying the player of progress or transitions.

With that, we‚Äôve now covered the core mechanics of the dialogue system in our multi-Bot RPG experience.
